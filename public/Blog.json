Start by preparing a designated space for your new pet, complete with essentials like bedding, toys, and water. Ensure your home is safe by pet-proofing areas that could pose risks, like securing cords and removing small objects. Give your pet time to adjust by allowing them to explore their new environment at their own pace. Introduce them gradually to other pets or family members to prevent overwhelm. Patience and positive reinforcement will help build trust and make your pet feel at home faster.",

Additionally, training exercises that encourage relaxation and rewarding calm behavior can help reduce anxiety over time. Always consult with a veterinarian to find the best options for your pet.",
